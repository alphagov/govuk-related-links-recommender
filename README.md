## Python environment
Environment variables are used to store Big Query key and project_id. These need to be activated before
the make_functional_network.py script can be used. 

Environment variables are also used to locate data and model directories: DATA_DIR and MODEL_DIR. Make sure these are activated before runnning data pipeline.
